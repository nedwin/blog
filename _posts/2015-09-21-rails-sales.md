# Rails & Sales

## YCombinator President Sam Altman.

My dream team for starting a new product is one engineer and one business person. “Rails and Sales”.

The rails engineer can focus on building, business focuses on selling the product. Together they define what the product is.

Everything else can be outsourced, at least to start with.

Once you have some customers and some market validation you can start adding additional roles like design, more engineering resources etc.

I’m not quite ready to start my next thing yet but this is the formula I’ll be following.
